# Smart-Notes 
The Smart thinking Notes Webapplication

## Current status

Currently, the React App "smart-notes" is in final development, the release of v1.0 is currently nothing in the way.  However, database connections must be tested, so that you as a simple user only have to download and configure the releases. 

## Configuration

Download v1.0 via the Github releases, and upload it to your web server. From now on you can easily create notes.[^1]
